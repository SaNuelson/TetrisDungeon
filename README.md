## Yet to feature!

- Inventory system!
- The dungeon crawling itself!
- Equipment with diverse grids! (like in the gif above)
- Skill minos to slot in the said equipment, giving *AWESOME* powers!
- Aforementioned *AWESOME* powers!
- Enemies! That's right, no more punching the air.
- Game over screen!
- Settings! For like... setting the music and SFX volume and stuff.
- Music and SFX! For like... so the settings screen isn't empty.
- Some overly complicated minigames!
- Food items!
- Healing potions! To make the food items completely useless.
- And a lot more! Which I'm going to spend hours Googling and debugging!
